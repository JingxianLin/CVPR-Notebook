CVPR Hand's On Lab for Xilinx ML Suite
======================================

Introduction
------------

Welcome Xilinx's ML Suite Lab at CVPR. By completing this lab, you will
gain valuable hands on experience in using the Xilinx ML Suite. This lab
covers how to use Python APIs to deploy the included models, as well as
how to compile and quantize custom models with the xfDNN Python tools.

| The Lab is divided into three parts:
| **Part 1:** Using the xfDNN Compiler
| **Part 2:** Using the xfDNN Quantizer to recalibrate models
| **Part 3:** Putting it all together: Compile, Quantize and Deploy
