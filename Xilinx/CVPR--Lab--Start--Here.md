# CVPR Hand's On Lab for Xilinx ML Suite 

## Introduction 
Welcome Xilinx's ML Suite Lab at CVPR. By completing this lab, you will gain valuable hands on experience in using the Xilinx ML Suite. This lab covers how to use Python APIs to deploy the included models, as well as how to compile and quantize custom models with the xfDNN Python tools.

The Lab is divided into three parts:    
**Part 1:** Using the xfDNN Compiler  
**Part 2:** Using the xfDNN Quantizer to recalibrate models   
**Part 3:** Putting it all together: Compile, Quantize and Deploy
